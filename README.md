## Proposal

Cash Master is an application to manage your personal finances, from tracking spending, categorizing, to dividing your income to separate functions such as: 50% for monthly bills, 20% for savings, and 30% for entertainment. Data can be viewed as daily, weekly, or yearly, depending on user choice.
